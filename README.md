# Bangalore_House_Price_Prediction

## Business Problem:
Prices of real estate properties are sophisticatedly linked with  our economy.

Despite this, we do not have accurate measures of house prices based on the vast amount of data available.

Proper and justified prices of properties can  bring in a lot of transparency and trust back to the real estate industry, which is very important for most consumers especially in India.
## Objective:

The goal of this project is to predict house prices in Bengaluru city based on some features such as location, size/area , number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms.
We are using machine learning algorithm to create a predictive model.
## Dataset:
Bengaluru house price data set is used to create the model.
## OSEMN Pipeline:

I’ll be following a typical data science pipeline, which is call “OSEMN”-

1.) Obtaining the data is the first approach in solving the problem.

2.) Scrubbing or cleaning the data is the next step. This includes data imputation of missing or invalid data and fixing column names.

3.) Exploring the data will follow right after and allow further insight of what our dataset contains. Looking for any outliers or weird data. Understanding the relationship each explanatory variable has with the response variable resides here and we can do this with a correlation matrix.

4.) Modeling the data will give us our predictive power.

5.) INterpreting the data is last. With all the results and analysis of the data, what conclusion is made? What factors contributed most to employee turnover? What relationship of variables were found?
